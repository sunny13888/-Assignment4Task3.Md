# Test_graph.r script
```{r}
library(ggplot2) # We load in libraries
 library(plotly)
 setwd('~/mygraph2/bin/')  # We Change Directory
# We load in our dataframe
 mygenes <- read.csv('gene_dist_head.tsv', header= TRUE, sep = "\t",fill = TRUE) 
# We define a factor set of autosomes
 autosomes<-c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10",
 "11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22")  
# We create a new dataframe called 'genes' which only has autosomes, however we still have those additional factors
 genes<- mygenes[ which(mygenes$chr %in% autosomes), ] 
# We remove the factors and then order them so they are numerical order and not alphabetical
 genes$chr <- factor(genes$chr, levels = autosomes) 
 # We plot in ggplot 
 ggplot(data = genes) +  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1)
```

# Put X as feature
```{r}
ggplot(data = genes) +
 geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = feature))
```

# Lets put X as the chromosomes and then look at features
```{r}
ggplot(data = genes) +
 geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature))
```

# lets go to polar coordinates
```{r}
ggplot(data = genes) +
 geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1) +
 coord_polar()
```

# To have plotly work on the graph
```{r}
p<-ggplot(data = genes) + 
 geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1) 
# Re-render if ggplotly # Note sometimes it doesn't work well
 ggplotly(p) 
```
